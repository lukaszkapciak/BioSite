<h2>How to start ?</h2>

<p>
    1. In the first step, you should download sample data that will be used in the next stage by clicking
    @Html.ActionLink("Example Data", "ExampleData", "Home", null, new { download = "ExampleData.csv" }).
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    2. Then from the navigation bar from the <b>New data</b> select option <b>Read CSV data</b>.

</p>
<hr />
<p>
    3. Click <b>Choice Data File</b> button and select downloaded file <b>ExampleData.csv.</b><br />
    <b>File with miRname (optional)</b> should stay empty because probably you haven't special file with wall names.<br />
    And at the very end, set <b>Data first line (deafult first)</b> to 1 because the right data starts in the first row (no header in the data).<br/>
    When everything is set, click the button <b>Load</b>, the data will be loaded and the user will be redirected to the view of the current loaded data.

    4. Then, to make calculations from the navigation bar, select <b>Calculations</b> and <b>Calculate</b>.<br/>
    <img src="@Url.Content("~/Content/Help/img/helpImg3.png")" class="img-responsive" alt="">
    Here the user has a short form in front of him. In the first approach, it is recommended to leave the default values in the fields it is 10 000 for <b>Minimum value for Rmax</b>
    and 50 000 for <b>Numbers of predicted points between 2 points</b>. When everything is set, click the button <b>Calculate</b>.
    <img src="@Url.Content("~/Content/Help/img/helpImg4.png")" class="img-responsive" alt="">
    The user will see the loader indicating that the calculations are in progress (the length of calculations depends on the input parameters) and the end will be redirected to the results screen. 
    The fact that all calculations have been completed will indicate the re-loading of the blue bar at the very bottom of the page.
</p>

    5. On the screen of views, the calculated values for all 96 wells are visible. Each of them is a developed div, where in the middle there is a short form allowing to recalculate the Ct value with other parameters and a graph visualizing the data, the threshold line and the Ct value if it was calculated.<br/>
    <img src="@Url.Content("~/Content/Help/img/helpImg5.png")" class="img-responsive" alt="">
    At the very top we have an additional three buttons. The first of these <b>Export to CSV</b> allows you to save the calculated results to a CSV file separated by the "/" sign.<br/>
    The second one <b>Recalculate data</b> allows you to convert the values of ΔΔCt and R for the whole result, including the recalculated Ct values.<br/>
    The last button <b>Previous State</b> allows you to undo the last step, which is to convert a single Ct or Ct + total data (NOTE: the undo function only works for the last converted Ct)
